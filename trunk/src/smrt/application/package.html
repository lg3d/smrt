Classes which manage and launch external applications.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The application manager keeps track of all the external applications that
smrt uses. It associates applications with file types so that when a user
selects a file, smrt can launch the appropriate application. The
<code>ApplicationManager</code> class uses a hash map to map regular
expressions to application factories.  Application factories, shown in
Figure 8, are used to create instances of the <code>Application</code> class --
or rather, instances of a subclass of Application.</p>
