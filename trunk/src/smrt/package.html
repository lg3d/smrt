The base smrt classes and utilities.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>The smrt package contains the pieces of the architecture which are
implemented in self-contained classes, as well as a few basic utility classes.
</p>

<p>The {@link org.jdesktop.lg3d.apps.smrt.MediaCenter MediaCenter} class is the
main class initiated by the launch script.  It sets up the Looking Glass,
then creates the <code>StateController</code> and
<code>ApplicationManager</code>
instances.  Finally, it pushes the menu described in data/menus/main.menu onto
the <code>StateController</code>'s Context stack and hands control flow over to
Looking Glass.</p>
