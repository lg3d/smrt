Menu and item classes.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Menus are the heart of smrt's user interface.  All menus inherit from an
abstract base class, <code>Menu</code>, that implements the
<code>Context</code> interface. Each <code>Menu</code> subclass is responsible
for tracking the items in the menu, handling event processing, and displaying
the menu items on screen. Menu classes use a layout class to position their
items on screen.  The layout classes position menu items on screen according to
the menu type; so for each menu type -- ring, arc, and cityscape -- there is a
corresponding layout class that displays the menu's items on the screen. The
<code>RingLayout</code> class, for example, places the items in a
<code>RingMenu</code> on screen in a circle, as shown in Figure 2. When a menu
receives an event that should change which menu item is currently selected, the
menu instructs its layout class to move its menu items to reflect this change.
This is effectively a Looking Glass implementation detail, but it makes it
possible to create specialized subclasses of a menu type without worrying
about reimplementing the layout mechanisms.</p>

<p>Special purpose menus (such as the <code>TvArcMenu</code> and
<code>FilesystemCity</code>) subclass one of the concrete menu classes to
implement their own functionality using one of the three menu layouts.  These
menus differ from their parents by how they populate themselves with menu
items. Most <code>Menu</code> subclasses are populated with items specified by
an XML file. These special purpose menus do not however. Rather, they override
their parent's realize() method to populate themselves when they are displayed.
For example the cityscape menu, used for browsing the file system, must create
menu items from files and directories in a given root directory. It would be
unreasonable to expect the user to produce an XML file specifying their entire
file system.</p>
