<h2>Project overview</h2>

<p>smrt is a media center application written using the Project Looking Glass
framework.  The goal of this project is to create a user interface for a home
media center along the lines of TiVo, but using 3D user interface elements
within the Looking Glass environment.</p>

<p>This is a conceptual diagram of the overall system. This diagram shows how
smrt interacts with its software and hardware environment. At the most basic
level, smrt allows a user to browse through and play media, as well as watch
or record a TV show. To control the system, a simple input device such as
keyboard or remote control is used.</p>

<h2>Design overview</h2>

<p>smrt's code can be divided coarsely into four modules: the state controller,
the application manager, menus, and applications. The
{@link org.jdesktop.lg3d.apps.smrt.StateController StateController}
tracks internal state changes. The
{@link org.jdesktop.lg3d.apps.smrt.application.ApplicationManager ApplicationManager}
handles interaction with external applications such as media players.  The
state controller and the application manager are created by the
{@link org.jdesktop.lg3d.apps.smrt.MediaCenter MediaCenter} class when smrt is
started. The menu package implements all of smrt's menu types.  In addition, it
contains some specialized subclasses of these menu types for implementing
specific behavior, such as a cityscape which browses the filesystem. The
application package represents external applications internally for the state
controller.</p>
