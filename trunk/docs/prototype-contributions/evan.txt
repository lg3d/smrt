In the beginning I helped to figure out how to use lg3d. I worked on drawing
images using their API, lighting them, and manipulating them with user input --
I drew a green box on the screen, lit it, and rotated it when the arrow keys
were pressed. This was primarily to better understand how to listen for events
in lg3d. After that, I helped David get the text working in the ring menu.
I accidentally discovered the Text2D widget in lg3d CVS while working on writing
my own text widget. After David implemented it to display the text, I figured
out how to calculate its width so we could center it under the images in the
menu. Then I started work on XMLTV integration. I created an XMLTV parser and
subclassed ArcMenu as TvArcMenu to display channel information. The parser is
still in need of debugging, but is fairly close to complete.
