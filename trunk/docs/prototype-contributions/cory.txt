During the prototyping stage of this project, I have contributed a large
amount of code to the project.  I have completed a preliminary (but fully
functional) city-scape style menu interface that includes full navigation
(using the arrow keys), the ability to traverse directories (both go in and
come back out), and also to select movies for playing.

Zooming effects are in place for all of the navigation, and I have also
implemented a feature that places sub-buildings on top of the main buildings
that correspond to the directory contents.

Preliminary support is in place for loading items and sub-items in the
background during rendering, but testing has shown it to be quite unstable,
producing occasional crashes and unpredictable behavior.  As such, this
functionality is disabled, loading everything at once in the foreground.
