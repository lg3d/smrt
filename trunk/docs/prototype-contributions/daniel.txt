For the prototyping stage of this project my main focus was the arc menu.  I
developed the interface for the arc menu that sub-classed our existing menu
interface.  The arc menu itself lays out a series of icons in a specified
locations.  The menu has support for user interaction, with the ability to
navigate by either single items or entire pages.
