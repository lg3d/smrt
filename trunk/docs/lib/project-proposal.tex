\section{Project Proposal}
Project Looking Glass is an open source development project based on and evolved
from Sun Microsystems' advanced technology project. It supports running unmodified
existing applications in a 3D space, as well as APIs for 3D window manager and
application development. Project Looking Glass has great potential for allowing
users to look at data in new ways from which they will be able to extract more
information.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of a 3D user interface for home media
centers for use with a TV (and possibly HDTV) display -- think 3D user interface for
TiVo. The main objective is to explore the UI possibilities, so this could be a
mockup or the team may want to integrate with an existing system such as MythTV.

Interesting areas to explore would be:
\begin{itemize}
\item the selection of programs to record
\item managing conflict of scheduled recordings
\item selection of programs to play
\item how the third dimension could be used to blend other features with the playing of a TV program
\end{itemize}
\end{flushleft}

Although the target hardware for such a system would be a set top box, we'd suggest
for this research the students use standard PCs, but constrain the resolution to TV
and HDTV quality.
